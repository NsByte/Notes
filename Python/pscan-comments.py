# This is my second python based port scanner.  The	#
# first scanner worked, but didnt had much logic and	#
# was coded less efficient. This (better/faster) 	#
# port scanner is more python3 based and makes use 	#
# of library 'optparse' for building a menu, 		#
# 'socket' for connecting to the remote socket and 	#
# module 'colorama' is used for coloring the 		# 
# screens output. This script will use a TCP 		#
# "stream" connection to connect the targets ip and 	#
# port address. When the script cannot connect to 	#
# the target it will give red output, if the 		#
# connection is successful the output will be green.	#
